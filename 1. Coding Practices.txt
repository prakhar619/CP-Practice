Question Attempt:
    1. Question Read Carefully. What is input and What is output?
    2. Methodology mentally
    3. Constrainst
    4. Final Methodology/Concept after considering constraint.
    5. All Flow decided (Theoretically)

    6. Code with conventions
        i. Hungarian Notation
        ii. great variable names
        iii. not look great, but eazy to debug
        iv. Convention:
            a. All Global variable: ALL CAPS
            b. Class Name: PascalCase
            c. Function / Method: Pascal Case
            d. Fields / Attributes : 
                3.i Private Member : _camelCase
                3.ii Static Member: s_camelCase
                3.iii Public: Pascal 
                3.iv Local variable: camelCase
    7. Control all flows (assertions)
    8. Final Revise for Typo/Silly/Miscell
