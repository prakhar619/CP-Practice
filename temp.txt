XOR
1. 0 | 0 -> 0
2. 1 | 0 -> 1
3. 0 | 1 -> 1
4. 1 | 1 -> 0

5. 10 ^ 10 = 0
6. 1 ^ 2 = 3
7. 10 ^ 0 = 10

Division Constraint
1. x / y then y cannot be zero

Multiply Constraint
1. Overflow

Array Constraint
1. Index out of bounds

Time Complexity:
1. Consider carefully O(1) from O(n) as loops does not always mean O(n)
2. Try to increase loop (when needed) without increasing time complexity


If you cant find condition check for not conditions

Optimisation
    1. Store index/ Rely of Index [Memory Optimisation]
        if its not changing, not destroying then use it.

Array & Stack -> Awesome Combination

2 Pointers and Sliding Window: Lot of optimisation on space and time because store only index and do not create lot of new array; (just change the already created ones)
