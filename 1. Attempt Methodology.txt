Question Attempt:
    1. Question Read Carefully. What is input and What is output?
    2. Methodology mentally
    3. Constrainst
    4. Final Methodology/Concept after considering constraint.
    5. All Flow decided (Theoretically)

    6. Code with conventions
        i. Hungarian Notation
        ii. great variable names
        iii. not look great, but eazy to debug
        iv. Convention:
            a. All Global variable: ALL CAPS
            b. Class Name: PascalCase
            c. Function / Method: Pascal Case
            d. Fields / Attributes : 
                3.i Private Member : _camelCase
                3.ii Static Member: s_camelCase
                3.iii Public: Pascal 
                3.iv Local variable: camelCase
    7. Control all flows (assertions)
    8. Final Revise for Typo/Silly/Miscell

    1. Question Name 
        Method 1: 
            Time Complexity 
            Description
                Answer why you thought of this approach, 
                Edge cases to check 
        Method 2:
            Time Complexity
            Description

Pattern Categories
I. Analysis Pattern
    1. Concrete Examples
    2. Case Analysis
    3. Iterative Refinement
    4. Reduction
    5. Graph Modelling
II. Algorithm Design Pattern
    1. Sorting
    2. Recursion 
    3. Divide and Conquer
    4. Dynamic Programming 
    5. Greedy Algorithm
    6. Invariant

Concrete Example:
    Start from a single example case,
    Build mathematical model for it 
    use Heuristic if required
 
Case Analysis 
    Divide question into cases 
    Case need not be mutually exclusive
    Must be exhaustive 

Iterative Refinement of Brute Force 
    Also called: Exhaustive Search \ Generate-And-Test 

Reduction
    Using other solution/function as a subroutine to solve the Problem

Graph Modelling 
    Make table/chart to find patterns




Invariant 
    an invariant is a condition that is true during execution of program 
    Identifying right invariant is ART
